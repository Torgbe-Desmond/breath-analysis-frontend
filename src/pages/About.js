      <p>
        Bad breath, also known as halitosis, is a common but often misunderstood
        condition. While it’s frequently treated as a simple hygiene issue,
        persistent bad breath can be influenced by a range of factors including
        oral health, diet, hydration, lifestyle habits, and underlying medical
        conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bad Breath Analysis was created to help bring clarity to this problem
        through structured data, honest self-reporting, and meaningful insights.

      <p>Our goal is not to diagnose, but to identify patterns.</p>
